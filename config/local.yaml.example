# local.yaml.example, if you'd like to override the settings in common.yaml, 
# this is how you do it. Just rename this file to local.yaml and you're in 
# business. 

# The file local.yaml is in .gitignore, so you won't accidentally commit it.

# First, you're probably going to want to work with your OWN fork of DSpace, 
# not the official DSpace repository, so just change the git_repo to match your
# fork. The example below won't work until you edit it.
git_repo          : 'git@github.com:yourgithubusername/DSpace.git'

# DSpace now builds its installer in a standard folder, target/dspace-installer, if you're building the master branch of DSpace, or any branch that includes the commit represented by
# SHA 93fc28277e2414ffe8da4f9c5da453bc597104bc (you can find this by running git branch --contains 93fc2827) if you're building an older version of DSpace, or your branch changes this default installer
# path for some other reason, you can over-ride the ant_isntaller_dir here. But it should not be necessary to override this setting, and we're commenting it out in this example file, just in case
# you don't read this comment, you'll still be able to build the master branch of DSpace using this example local.yaml file.
